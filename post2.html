          <p>If you've been working as an event planner or a field marketer you’re no stranger to last-minute changes or cancellations. Even so, the Coronavirus outbreak has presented a multitude of different challenges that have already had a drastic impact on the events industry, and in the short-term this is unlikely to change. Governments all over the world are advising people to avoid large gatherings, and some severely infected countries have enforced even stricter shutdowns.

            Event organisers, agencies and location owners all over the world are therefore looking for alternatives, and fortunately our increasingly connected offers ready-made technologies for them. Digital experiences can replace physical experiences (and other face-to-face marketing initiatives) both effectively and safely in these uncertain times. The unique affordances of AR and VR in all their forms present viable and engaging solutions for experiential marketers.</p>

          

          <h2 class="section-heading">USE A TECHNOLOGY THAT'S ALREADY IN YOUR POTENTIAL VISITORS' POCKET</h2>

          <p>There's already a device in their pockets that can bring the live experience to their living room during self-isolation.

            Our MobileAR technology provides a creative and highly effective “edutainment” tool that adds an extra layer of information – content such as 3D characters, image, video, text, sound and more – to everyday objects and environments. This content can be live, too, offering the potential to revolutionise conferences, seminars or even stand-up comedy nights.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">APP-FREE EXPERIENCES FOR ALL PLATFORMS</h2>

          <p>We've been creating augmented reality applications for iOS and Android smartphones, tablets and wearable devices since 2013. This has allowed us to create a range of exciting experiences - such as showing how the great artists painted for an art gallery, or bringing the Guinness World Records book to life. 

            For those who want to look outside of a mobile application infrastructure, especially if it was developed only for one particular event, Web-based AR offers a relatively new but very exciting opportunity.
            
            WebAR is augmented reality that can be accessed from a web browser instead of native apps or social media platforms. Users can simply access these on-the-go experiences by scanning QR codes, using the capabilities their phone already has. As it doesn't require downloading an extra application, it takes up less memory, not to mention that it offers faster deployment time with fewer costs. While it offers limited functionality comparing our MobileAR applications, it provides a frictionless experience that your visitors, customers or fans can quickly engage with.</p>

         
            <h2 class="section-heading">CAN'T GO TO A CONCERT? BRING THE ARTIST TO YOUR LIVING ROOM!</h2>

          

          <p>Whilst we all love a live concert experience and its unique form of engagement, it’s not the only way you can reach your audience. Many DJs and musicians who all rely heavily on revenue earned from live shows have already started streaming concerts over Facebook and YouTube. You can take this experience to the next level with VR technology.

            The world's leading entertainment company Live Nation has already tackled this opportunity. They’ve already broadcast dozens of concerts in VR for their fans, and have enhanced their offerings by providing “extras” such as behind-the-scene backstage footage where fans can follow their favourite artists as they take the stage. Pro basketball leagues such as NBA and NCAA have been quick to jump on that bandwagon, too: they’ve been already broadcasting games in VR for some time now with considerable success.</p>
